/**
 * Authorization is the Meter's job; atomic condition checks are the Store's job.
 * Store does not take AccessContext. Meter resolves applicable budgets, funding and price policy.
 * Each command atomically re-checks state, version, lease ownership, budget headroom
 * including outstanding reservations, and command replay identity.
 * A Meter-side check is never sufficient. Expected rejections return typed outcomes, not exceptions.
 * Admission includes unsettled reservations across all applicable bounds.
 * Reserve selects current budgets atomically by namespace, scope, surface, units and pools.
 * Host ownership resolution, authorization and pool-figure redaction belong to Meter.
 * Adapters prove these guarantees through one conformance suite, without callback locks.
