 * Renewal, recovery and expiry sweeps have no command journal: inspect the operation before retrying.
 * Billing imports are never retried automatically. After RemoteUnavailable, explicitly resend the
 * identical input, including fileHash and expectedPreviousImportId, to replay its durable result.
